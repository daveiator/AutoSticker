# Auto-Sticker
##### V2.0
![Preview](/images/sticker_wall_flat.png)
| **Node Overview** | ![node](/images/node.png) |
| --- | --- |
| **Seed** | Just a random seed input |
| **Specular** | Controls how many stickers are glossy or metallic |
| **Damage** | Controls the tear and wear effects of the stickers |
| **Wrinkles** | Controls the bump mapping on the stickers |

* To use the stickers in your projects, simply append the AutoSticker Object.

* To change out the image, go inside the "_AutoSticker Image" node.

* You can add object duplicates, linked duplicates or just add more faces in Edit-Mode. Note that each "Sticker-Square" takes up the entire uv grid!

* Also, there is no "Random per Island" node in Eevee, so by default it uses a Geometry-Nodes Modifier which generates a random color-map dynamically. If this shader is mainly used in cycles, you can go into the "randomization settings" and use the "Random per Island" node instead.

Alright, have fun with it and stay awesome! :D
